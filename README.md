More Furnaces: Omnifactory Edition
================

A continuation of MoreFurnaces by Cubex2, maintained by the Omnifactory Dev team, and slimmed down by SuperslowJelly of Complex-MC.

This mod adds multiple tiers of furnaces: Iron, Gold, Diamond, Obsidian, and Netherrack. These furnaces are faster and more efficient than vanilla furnaces, and gain additional benefits like multiple input and output slots, or even parallel processing.
